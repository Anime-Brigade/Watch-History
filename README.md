# Watch History

## Layout of JSON File:
The data is organized by club session. Early club sessions were not tracked by
semester, so full years are used. Within that, data is organized by type of
meeting. Shows are then listed (see "General Formatting"). Also included is data
to identify the show and its themes that are used by the brigade themes page.

### General Formatting:
Anime ids, for the purpose of consistancy and readability, are taken from the
"anime slug" of the animethemes.moe API. If there is no such slug for an anime,
the MAL code (from the URL) is used, with all non-alphanumeric characters
replaced with underscores and multiple underscores in a row condensed to one.
